    <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
    
    <p>My teaching philosophy is based on the following principles:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Learning requires strongly motivated students.</strong>
            <p>The unmotivated will be reluctant to put the time and effort needed to succeed in the task. To achieve a high level of student motivation, I:</p>
            
            <div class="sub-points">
                <p>highlight the links between the material taught and the students' previous experiences</p>
                <p>help them make the connections in order to understand how Chemistry touches most aspects of their daily lives</p>
                <p>conduct at least one lecture demonstration every time I introduce a new chapter or key concept. A successful example I used during the Summer 03 session is the direct reaction between iodine and sodium to obtain sodium iodide. This one is an impressive demo, safer than the traditional sodium and chlorine reaction, that can be used to show the chemistry of these elements, combination and redox type of reactions and the resulting solid can be analyzed using an x-ray diffractometer. A full description of the experiment can be found in 
					<a href="demo.html" class="note-link">Supporting Documents C.6</a></p>
                <p>manifest in class the amazement and excitement I feel about the science I am teaching. I found it useful to expose the students to news and comments about the latest progress in the field. When teaching General Chemistry, I have managed to arrange visits to the Materials Research Center and to the Chemistry Department research labs, so that the students see "Chemists at work". A draft of the project for one of the visits is found in <a href="visiting.html" class="note-link">Supporting Documents C.5</a></p>
            </div>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>All learners are not created equal.</strong>
            <p>I strive to adapt my teaching to the individual learning styles and special needs of each student, taking care that nobody feels left behind in my class:</p>
            
            <div class="sub-points">
                <p>some students require extra help in order to visualize abstract concepts, and they need to be supplied with concrete examples, even in cases when finding such examples is extremely challenging, for example, when explaining the meaning of an atomic wavefunction or Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle</p>
                <p>because of varying levels of Math preparation, some students have difficulties operating with ratios, which is a fundamental ability required to master stoichiometric calculations. For that type of students I try to find understandable similes related to everyday life</p>
                <p>and even some times, they want to know more than what I can fit into the tight course schedule. In that case, I have developed supplemental material, so that they can satisfy their learning desire without interfering with the development of the course. An example of such handouts, developed at the request of a student who wanted to know more about the kinetic molecular theory of gases is supplied in <a href="kinetic handout.pdf" class="note-link">Supporting Documents C.4</a></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="note">
                This individual attention does not mean in any way that at the time of evaluation I would compromise the standards of the course, the passing grade has to be earned based on individual effort and progress and certainly not based on "statistics".
            </div>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>A fundamental goal of Chemistry coursework is to enable the application of the acquired knowledge to the solution of problems</strong>
            <p>oftentimes in particular situations never met before. In my practice as a Chemistry instructor I find that the main obstacle to successful problem solving is the inability to create the appropriate mental representations of the given data. I take special care to expose them to many different types of problems, and as I solve examples on the board I point out the various problem-solving strategies used and to the details of the models scientists have built to better understand the chemical transformation in the world around us. When it is time to evaluate what has been learned, I write always my own problems. They require the application of the concepts we have touched in class, oftentimes in new situations, requiring a more creative approach rather than bringing back half-digested information acquired by rote memorization. Examples of these type of quizzes and exams are given as <a href="quizzes.html" class="note-link">Supporting Documents A.3</a></p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>Grades are of secondary importance when compared to learning.</strong>
            <p>I make that clear to my students from the very first day, thus helping them to get rid of "grade anxiety". In my opinion, good test-taking habits are a valuable asset for the continuation of their studies, and therefore I tend to administer tests that require the development and application of such habits. For example, by making midterm exams relatively long for the time allotted, I encourage them to read the whole test and decide which are the easiest and least time consuming questions and to do those first. In that way they also learn to avoid wasting time in questions that are beyond their level of preparation.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>Laboratory work is fundamental for the understanding of chemistry.</strong>
            <p>It is the most important contribution we make to the development of good observation habits and to the application of the scientific method in our approach to nature. In the lab the students get a real feel of what chemistry is all about. In most of my teaching duties, I have had the opportunity of teaching both the lectures and the labs, which has given me a great chance to follow the students' development and of making sure that both parts of the course seamlessly complement each other.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>The instructor is one more resource for learning.</strong>
            <p>I find it a good strategy to let the students know from the beginning of the course, that the instructor is not some sort of magician with the power to install Chemistry into dormant brains, but one more resource (together with the textbook, the study guides, the tutors, the web, etc) for the important task in which each of them as individuals is about to embrace for the duration of the term and beyond: the learning of Chemistry, a.k.a. The Central Science.</p>
