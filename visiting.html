<h2><font face="Arial">Visiting UCSB Research labs: &quot;Chemists at work&quot;</font></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Project:</h3>
<p>It was drafted in an e-mail sent to the Director of Educational Programs at
MRL-UCSB</p>
<p><font face="Courier">> Date: Tuesday, July 15, 2003<br>
> Time: 12 noon to 3:00 pm<br>
><br>
> This is a group of 25 students taking freshman chemistry at Santa Barbara<br>
> City College during the summer session (If successful, and it surely will,<br>
> I plan to repeat this activity during the fall semester).<br>
><br>
> A tentative schedule:<br>
><br>
> 12:00 - 12:40 pm The students gather at MRL Conference Room and a group of<br>
> chemist (senior and assistant professors, staff technicians, graduate<br>
> students) talk to them for 5- 10 min each about what they do in their daily<br>
> lives as chemist working at UCSB. Slides would help.<br>
><br>
> 12:40 - 1:00 pm A brief tour ot the MRL facility so that they see that<br>
> there is a lot of interesting science going on here.<br>
><br>
> 1:00 - 3:00 pm They will be working in teams of 6 students learning more<br>
> directly what x-ray diffraction is in reality, taking a close look at the<br>
> diffractometers and running (with the assistance of researchers and staff)<br>
> the solid samples they will bring from their labs and demos in class. It<br>
> would be very good if they could see the data processing as well (matching<br>
> the diffractograms to those of known substances, indexing the peaks<br>
> etc.).  The data collected should be saved as ASCII files in their floppy<br>
> disks. They are expected to turn in a detailed report of the visit and what<br>
> they learned here.<br>
><br>
> I guess I could bring one of the groups to the diffraction laboratory in<br>
> the Chemistry dept., one group could go to the diffractometer with Joe<br>
> Doyle and other group with Youli Li. There is still one more group to<br>
> place. I don't know if Mario Yasa could get that one, I don't  think there<br>
> are any more powder diffractometers available. Does the Material Dept. have<br>
> any? I would appreciate any suggestions of alternative schedules.<br>
><br>
> Thanks,</font></p>

<h3>The Visit</h3>
<p><img border="0" src="Pictures/visit01.jpg" width="700" height="525"></p>
<p>Doctoral candidate P. Foster explains the use of inductevely-coupled plasma
atomic emission spectrometer in his research involving novel solid state
materials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="Pictures/visit02.jpg" width="700" height="525"></p>
<p>Dr. James Pavlovich, manager of the mass spectrometry facility of the
Chemistry Department at UCSB shows different aspects of the application of this
technique in chemical research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="Pictures/visit03.jpg" width="700" height="525"></p>
<p>Dr. John Gomm explains the use of the x-ray diffractometer, where the
students will analyze the samples of crystalline solids they prepared in their
labs.</p>
