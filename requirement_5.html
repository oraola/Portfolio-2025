<h2><font face="Arial">Requirement 5: The Teaching Portfolio</font></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The preparation of this teaching portfolio has been a unique chance to
perform some&nbsp; reflection on my teaching activity at UCSB. Through
the careful analysis of the student ratings in all the courses I taught I have
been able to spot weak points and work hard on them (for example, adjusting the
level and length of evaluative exercises). Also I have been prompted to develop
instructional strategies, like the use of graphical models and trying to link
the contents of the chemistry class to the student's everyday life experience,
so that more difficult or abstract concepts can be grasped and effectively
understood. On the other hand, when I have received positive feedback from the
students, some of my doubts and fears were happily dispelled, for example, my
concern about clear and loud oral expression when teaching.</p>
<p>The fulfillment of all requirements had some interesting challenges for me,
like sitting in a graduate course in the Psychology department. After completing
the course, I was satisfied to have acquired better tools in order to understand
the learning and problem-solving processes. It was also very rewarding to
realize that this new knowledge had come directly from an excellent teacher and
internationally acclaimed leading experts in his field.</p>
<p>In summation, I consider the preparation of the portfolio very useful and I
expect to use it to the fullest in my job search for an academic position.</p>
