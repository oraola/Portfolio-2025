    <h2>Requirement 3: Introducing new instructional technologies in the freshman Chemistry course</h2>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h3>3.1 Motivation and instructional goals</h3>
        <div class="motivation-section">
            <p>The way in which atoms associate among themselves to form molecules and crystals has a profound effect on the physical and chemical properties of the resulting aggregates. Among the main learning goals of the General Chemistry courses we find the understanding of different theories that explain the structure and geometric shapes of molecules and ions. The traditional instructional materials offer many two-dimensional representations of these chemical species, but the ultimate understanding comes only from the manipulation of 3-D structural models.</p>
            
            <p>The laboratory course for Chemistry 155 at Santa Barbara City College has traditionally included a session dedicated to molecular modeling. During that lab the students had the chance to use ball-and-stick and metal spokes models that helped them to visualize and draw the shape of typical molecules corresponding to diverse hybridization and number of lone pairs around the central atom.</p>
            
            <p>But the use of these "physical" models is somewhat limited because it takes a lot of time and effort to build models for large molecules and some geometries and orbital types cannot be represented by them in a convincing way, e.g., the structure of benzene.</p>
            
            <p>In order to offer the students enrolled in this class a feel for the way in which chemist nowadays build molecular models and study many properties of substances without stepping into a lab, I decided to introduce the use of computer simulations of the molecular structures of interest. My goal was not to substitute what they had done before with the ball-and-stick sets, but to extend their experience by incorporating the use of the computer resources available at SBCC.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h3>3.2 Description of the project</h3>
        <p>To develop this project I first researched the chemical education literature in order to find out about the experiences already reported by many educators in this field around the world. Based on the reports I found, I decided to evaluate four different software packages:</p>
        
        <div class="software-table">
            <h4>Evaluated Software Packages</h4>
            <ul class="software-list">
                <li><a href="http://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker/">Tinker (U. Washington)</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.serenasoft.com/">PC Model (Serena Software)</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.wavefun.com/spartan-student">Spartan (Wavefunction, Inc.)</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://hypercubeusa.com/">HyperChem (Hypercube, Inc.)</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>I contacted the vendors to acquire the corresponding evaluation copies. The criteria used to select the appropriate software were:</p>
        
        <div class="criteria-list">
            <ul>
                <li>ease of use,</li>
                <li>quality of the graphical output,</li>
                <li>price</li>
                <li>possibility of drawing and minimizing the energy of the structure.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>The package selected was HyperChem, known for its ease of use and powerful graphical and calculation capabilities. The makers of the software also offer an educational "Lite" version that turned out to be really affordable.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h3>3.3 Implementation</h3>
        <div class="implementation-section">
            <p>For the first session where the use of computers was introduced in the course, I could use the demo version distributed freely by Hypercube. Based on the package documentation I printed a brief handout for the students and guided them from a computer connected to a data projector.</p>
            
            <p>The generation of freshman in this year (2003) grew up with computers and video games, and instructors belonging to older generations (as we all were at SBCC) will find that the students become capable of orienting themselves in front of a new software program at an amazing speed.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example-links">
            <h4>Student-Generated Molecular Models</h4>
            <p>The supporting documents include two example screenshots of molecules that they built from scratch and studied during the lab session:</p>
            <p>- <a href="if5.htm">iodine pentafluoride, IF<sub>5</sub></a>, showing an octahedral electronic distribution around the central atom that creates a square pyramidal molecule because of the presence of one lone pair on the iodine atom, and</p>
            <p>- <a href="formic.htm">formic acid, HCOOH</a>, where they could explore the asymmetry of the electron distribution on the molecule that gives rise to its polarity, as shown by the 2-D contour lines in the figure.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h3>3.4 Students feedback</h3>
        <div class="feedback-section">
            <p>An informal survey after the completion of the lab showed that the students appreciated very much the opportunity to reinforce their knowledge about molecular geometry and structure by using a molecular modeling program, that most of them were willing to spend more hours on this type of task and that as a consequence of this innovation introduced in their curriculum they were better prepared when they had to take the midterm and final tests in the semester.</p>
            
            <p>Based on the positive input from the students and on the enthusiasm shown by other faculty members about the possibilities of using HyperChem for other chemistry classes, I wrote a proposal to the Dean of Physical Sciences and Engineering and succeeded in the purchase of a site license so that the students and instructors from now on will have this new and powerful resource at their hands.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h3>3.5 Reflection on the completion of Requirement 3</h3>
        <div class="reflection-section">
            <p>In fulfilling this task I found that the introduction of new electronic media is not always a painless task, mainly in institutions where the same course have been taught for many years without them. But talking to the fellow faculty members, and giving a practical demonstration of the power of these new tools will generally succeed in gaining their support for the task of taking our teaching to 21st century level. As a future professor, I will keep my commitment to this task, backed by the experience acquired in working at Santa Barbara City College.</p>
