<h2><font face="Arial">Requirement 3:<br>
Introducing new instructional technologies in the freshman Chemistry course</font></h2>
<h3><a name="tth_sEc3.1">3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Motivation and instructional goals</h3>
The way in which atoms associate among themselves to form molecules and crystals
has a profound effect on the physical and chemical properties of the resulting
aggregates. Among the main learning goals of the General Chemistry courses we
find the understanding of different theories that explain the structure and
geometric shapes of molecules and ions. The traditional instructional materials
offer many two-dimensional representations of these chemical species, but the
ultimate understanding comes only from the manipulation of 3-D structural
models.
<p>
The laboratory course for Chemistry 155 at Santa Barbara City College has
traditionally included a session dedicated to molecular modelling. During that
lab the students had the chance to use ball-and-stick and metal spokes models
that helped them to visualize and draw the shape of typical molecules
corresponding to diverse hybridization and number of lone pairs around the
central atom.
<p>
But the use of these &quot;physical&quot; models is somewhat limited because it
takes a lot of time and effort to build models for large molecules and some
geometries and orbital types cannot be represented by them in a convincing way,
e. g., the structure of benzene.
<p>
In order to offer the students enrolled in this class a feel for the way in
which chemist nowadays build molecular models and study many properties of
substances without stepping into a lab, I decided to introduce the use of
computer simulations of the molecular structures of interest. My goal was not to
substitute what they had done before with the ball-and-stick sets, but to extend
their experience by incorporating the use of the computer resources available at
SBCC.
<h3><a name="tth_sEc3.2">3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Description of the project</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 18">
To develop this project I first researched the chemical education literature in
order to find out about the experiences already reported by many educators in
this field around the world. Based on the reports I found, I decided to evaluate
four different software packages:&nbsp;
<table border="0" width="37%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" align="left">
      <p style="margin-left: 36"><a href="http://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker/"> Tinker (U.
      Washington)</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" align="left">
      <p style="margin-left: 36"><a href="http://www.serenasoft.com/pcm8.html"> PC Model (Serena
      Software)</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" align="left">
      <p style="margin-left: 36"><a href="http://www.wavefun.com/software/spartan04_win_student/win_student_main.html"> Spartan
      (Wavefunction, Inc.)</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" align="left">
      <p style="margin-left: 36"><a href="http://www.hyper.com"> HyperChem (Hypercube,
      Inc.)</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> I
contacted the vendors to acquire the corresponding evaluation copies. The
criteria used to select the appropriate software were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ease of use,</li>
  <li>quality of the graphical output,</li>
  <li>price</li>
  <li>possibility of drawing and minimizing the energy of the structure.</li>
</ul>
The package selected was HyperChem, known for its ease of use and powerful
graphical and calculation capabilities. The makers of the software also offer an
educational &quot;Lite&quot; version that turned out to be really affordable.
<h3><a name="tth_sEc3.3">3.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation</h3>
For the first session where the use of computers was introduced in the course, I
could use the demo version distributed freely by Hypercube. Based on the package
documentation I printed a brief handout for the students and guided them from a
computer connected to a data projector.
<p>
The generation of freshman in this year (2003) grew up with computers and video
games, and instructors belonging to older generations (as we all were at SBCC)
will find that the students become capable of orienting themselves in front of a
new software program at an amazing speed. The supporting documents include two example screenshots of
molecules that they built from scratch and studied during the lab session: <br>
-<a href="if5.htm">iodine pentafluoride, IF<sub>5</sub>,</a> showing an
octahedral electronic distribution around the central atom that creates a square
pyramidal molecule because of the presence of one lone pair on the iodine atom,
and <br>
-<a href="formic.htm">formic acid, HCOOH,</a> where they could explore the
asymmetry of the electron distribution on the molecule that gives rise to its
polarity, as shown by the 2-D contour lines in the figure.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3.4 Students feedback</h3>
<p>An informal survey after the completion of the lab showed that the students
appreciated very much the opportunity to reinforce their knowledge about
molecular geometry and structure by using a molecular modelling program, that
most of them were willing to spend more hours on this type of task and that as a
consequence of this innovation introduced in their curriculum they were better
prepared when they had to take the midterm and final tests in the
semester.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the positive input from the students and on the enthusiasm shown by
other faculty members about the possibilities of using Hyperchem for other
chemistry classes, I wrote a proposal to the Dean of Physical Sciences and
Engineering and succeeded in the purchase of a site license so that the students
and instructors from now on will have this new and powerful resource at their
hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3.5 Reflection on the completion of Requirement 3</h3>
<p>In fulfilling this task I found that the introduction of new electronic media
is not always a painless task, mainly in institutions where the same course have
been taught for many years without them. But talking to the fellow faculty
members, and giving a practical demonstration of the power of these new tools
will generally succeed in gaining their support for the task of taking our
teaching to 21st century level. As a future professor, I will keep my commitment
to this task, backed by the experience acquired in working at Santa Barbara City
College.&nbsp;</p>
