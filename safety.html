<p>Safety is a major concern in a Chemistry lab and I am considered to be very
strict regarding the observation of safety rules. Some students consider this
emphasis some kind of nuisance, but I never get tired of repeating: &quot;Safety
first&quot;.&nbsp; A specific topic that requires extreme attention is&nbsp; having them wear their goggles every time there is a hazard for their

eyes. But again, I guess it is much better for them to feel overprotected by the TA&nbsp;
rather than suffering any kind of

eye injury in the lab. </p>
