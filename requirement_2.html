    <h2>Requirement 2: Psychology 237 Cognition</h2>
    
    <div class="course-overview">
        <p>It was a useful experience to learn about the steps taken in problem-solving. From the start I told the instructor, prof. Richard Mayer, that my main goal in studying cognition was to understand when the problem-solving process fails, when we do not succeed in training our students as good problem solvers.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="key-insight">
        <h3>Mental Representations in Problem-Solving</h3>
        <p>I learned that the first step in problem-solving is the building of mental representations of the data. In my teaching practice I have observed that a lot of trouble comes from the inability of the students to create the appropriate mental representations for very abstract concepts, and then operate with them.</p>
        
        <p>Solving stoichiometry problems requires the proper representation of the chemical principles involved before any attempt of solution. Therefore, the students were instructed to start always by writing a completed balanced chemical equation of the process. But as an aid to the proper representation building, I used an idea found also in their textbook: represent pictorially the <em>units</em> involved. In this way the problem became clearer and their solutions was easier.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="research-example">
        <h3>Research Application: Working Memory Limitations</h3>
        <p>In preparing for the midterms of Cognition, I had the chance of getting acquainted with many interesting research papers in the area of college chemistry teaching. In one of the reviewed studies about problem solving in chemistry, the effects of the limitation of human working memory when faced with complicated chemical tasks were investigated. By observing how large groups of students approached problems stated in specific ways in exams, the researchers could discover that the probability of finding a correct answer was undoubtedly influenced by the presentation of the problem.</p>
        
        <p>The limitations of the working memory can be made for by the development of graphical aids on paper (I could add that now even in a computer screen). For example: students were asked was heavier: a liter of dry air or a litter of air at the same temperature and pressure that was saturated in water vapor (the average molar mass of air is 29 g/mol and that of water is 18 g/mol). For the problem stated with words, most students answered that wet air was heavier. But if the problem was presented graphically, with cartoonish representations of the molecules inside the container, most respondents could understand that since Avogadro's principle states that equal volumes of gases contain equal number of particles and since air is on the average heavier than water, then the liter of wet air is actually lighter than the liter of dry air.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="application-section">
        <h3>Classroom Implementation</h3>
        <p>I had the chance of assigning the same problem to my students as an extra-credit homework, and found that none of them could find the right solution when the problem was presented only in words, but then with the aid of graphics in my PowerPoint presentation developed for the class, they could finally get a fine understanding of Avogadro's principle.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="reflection-section">
        <h3>Professional Growth and Future Applications</h3>
        <p>In retrospective, I think that the challenge of taking a graduate course in the Psychology department was a worthy effort. The discovery of the importance of mental representations in the solution of problems, as illustrated by the Avogadro's principle problem above, opened up my own understanding of my role as a teacher and certainly increased my value as a resource for the students. These new ideas will be carried over to my future activity as a professor of Chemistry, hopefully for the benefit of my future students.</p>
