<h2><font face="Arial">Requirement 2:<br>
Psychology 237 Cognition</font></h2>
It was a useful experience to learn about the steps taken in problem-solving.
From the start I told the instructor, prof. Richard Mayer, that my main goal in
studying cognition was to understand when the problem-solving process fails,
when we do not succeed in training our students as good problem solvers.
<p>
I learned that the first step in problem-solving is the building of mental
representations of the data. In my teaching practice I have observed that a lot
of trouble comes from the inability of the students to create the appropriate
mental representations for very abstract concepts, and then operate with them.
Solving stoichiometry problems requires the proper representation of the
chemical principles involved before any attempt of solution. Therefore, the
students were instructed to start always by writing a completed balanced
chemical equation of the process. But as an aid to the proper representation
building, I used an idea found also in their textbook: represent pictorially the
<em>units</em> involved. In this way the problem became clearer and their
solutions was easier.
<p>
In preparing for the midterms of Cognition, I had the chance of getting
acquainted with many interesting research papers in the area of college
chemistry teaching. In one of the reviewed studies about problem solving in
chemistry, the effects of the limitation of human working memory when faced with
complicated chemical tasks were investigated. By observing how large groups of
students approached problems stated in specific ways in exams, the researchers
could discover that the probability of finding a correct answer was undoubtedly
influenced by the presentation of the problem. The limitations of the working
memory can be made for by the development of graphical aids on paper (I could
add that now even in a computer screen). For example: students were asked was
heavier: a liter of dry air or a litter of air at the same temperature and
pressure that was saturated in water vapor (the average molar mass of air is 29
g/mol and that of water is 18 g/mol). For the problem stated with words, most
students answered that wet air was heavier. But if the problem was presented
graphically, with cartoonish representations of the molecules inside the
container, most respondents could understand that since Avogadro's principle
states that equal volumes of gases contain equal number of particles and since
air is on the average heavier than water, then the liter of wet air is actually
lighter than the liter of dry air.
<p>
I had the chance of assigning the same problem to my students as an extra-credit
homework, and found that none of them could find the right solution when the
problem was presented only in words, but then with the aid of graphics in my
Powerpoint presentation developed for the class, they could finally get a fine
understanding of Avogadro's principle.
<p>
In retrospective, I think that the challenge of taking a graduate course in the Psychology department was a
worthy effort. The discovery of the importance of mental representations in the
solution of problems, as illustrated by the Avogadro's principle problem above,
opened up my own understanding of my role as a teacher and certainly increased
my value as a resource for the students. These new ideas will be carried over to
my future activity as a professor of Chemistry, hopefully for the benefit of my
future students.
