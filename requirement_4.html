<h2><font face="Arial">Requirement 4:<br>
Instructor of Record for Chem 155 at Santa Barbara City College, Summer 2003</font></h2>
The challenge of compressing a semester's worth of content into six weeks was my
main concern when I got the assignment to teach this class.
<p>I spent a lot of time preparing the lectures ahead of the start of classes and
also during the summer itself. I will be teaching again this course in the Fall,
but at the traditional rate, and I guess it will be an easier task all around.
In this way I will be able to include even more demonstrations in my lectures,
like the one included in <a href="demo.htm"> Supporting Documents C.6</a>, something
that students generally enjoyed.
<p>
During the preparation for this task, I found that the two years working as a
Teaching Assistant at UCSB had prepared me really well to meet the challenge:
preparing a course syllabus, grading the laboratory reports and producing
lecture demonstration that are both somewhat spectacular but mainly instructive
were some of the tasks that I felt I could do with much greater ease because of
my past teaching experiences.
<p>
Since I had taken the Psychology 237: Cognition course right before the start of
the Summer session, I felt compelled to test in practice the many useful
pedagogical tools just acquired. I used some of the interesting problems found
in my preparation for the Psychology class as extra-credit assignment for my
students, and some of them were very motivated by these type of problems.
<p>
Having gotten deeper knowledge into the theories that explain scientific problem
solving by humans, I could implement in my teaching some of the important
principles learned. The need to create the right mental representations in order
to be solve problems in general and in the particular case of chemistry,
inspired me into the use of Powerpoint slides and animations throughout the
lecture course at any point where the visualization of the microscopic phenomena
by means of macroscopic analogs would help the students' understanding.
<p>
The introduction of computer modelling into the chemical curriculum of Santa
Barbara City College is probably the most important contribution I have made to
science education while fulfilling the requisites for this certificate. My
fellow faculty members at SBCC were also very pleased to have this new teaching
tool available for future use in their classes.
<p>
For this course I elaborated a rather complete syllabus, that can be found as <a href="http://www.studenthub.org/syllabus/syllabus.php?id=5457916" target="_blank">Supporting
Document C.1</a>. It contains most of the information needed to go through and
succeed in the course, a detailed calendar of all activities and laboratories,
and listing of paper and electronic resources available for the students. It
took some work to get them used to look it up in the syllabus before asking, but
in the long run, I guess they benefited form such a comprehensive document. The
syllabus was handled as a paper copy during the first class, but it was also
available on the web. I developed the syllabus using the <a href="http://www.studenthub.org/syllabus/start.php">Syllabus
Maker</a> software available at The Student Hub webstie. The students were
required to visit the web version at least once a week, and that allowed me to communicate
important changes and updates to the whole class. I have adopted this format for
other courses taught after the first, and I hope as a future professor to
continue this approach to the all-important syllabus.&nbsp;<p>Reflecting on this teaching experience, I learned about the differences in
the needs and motivations of students at a community college and compared them
with my previous experience as a teacher at a research university. The fact that
the course taught at the City College is University of California transferable convinced me that I
should not lower the level of the course but just put an extra effort in trying
to bring all students to full speed in General Chemistry.&nbsp;The importance of
having a well-organized and complete syllabus became evident to me, specially
during the Summer session, when work is done under such great time constrains. I
have the great opportunity of teaching the class again during the Fall semester,
and all what I learned during the first run, found suitable application during
the second. I guess that is the way in real file, where as a teacher you are
always committed to improve your own record from the last time you taught the
course.</p>
