    <h2>Requirement 4: Instructor of Record for Chem 155 at Santa Barbara City College, Summer 2003</h2>
    
    <div class="course-overview">
        <p>The challenge of compressing a semester's worth of content into six weeks was my main concern when I got the assignment to teach this class.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="preparation-section">
        <h3>Course Preparation and Development</h3>
        <p>I spent a lot of time preparing the lectures ahead of the start of classes and also during the summer itself. I will be teaching again this course in the Fall, but at the traditional rate, and I guess it will be an easier task all around. In this way I will be able to include even more demonstrations in my lectures, like the one included in <a href="demo.html" class="external-link">Supporting Documents C.6</a>, something that students generally enjoyed.</p>
        
        <p>During the preparation for this task, I found that the two years working as a Teaching Assistant at UCSB had prepared me really well to meet the challenge: preparing a course syllabus, grading the laboratory reports and producing lecture demonstration that are both somewhat spectacular but mainly instructive were some of the tasks that I felt I could do with much greater ease because of my past teaching experiences.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="psychology-integration">
        <h3>Application of Cognitive Psychology Principles</h3>
        <p>Since I had taken the Psychology 237: Cognition course right before the start of the Summer session, I felt compelled to test in practice the many useful pedagogical tools just acquired. I used some of the interesting problems found in my preparation for the Psychology class as extra-credit assignment for my students, and some of them were very motivated by these type of problems.</p>
        
        <p>Having gotten deeper knowledge into the theories that explain scientific problem solving by humans, I could implement in my teaching some of the important principles learned. The need to create the right mental representations in order to be solve problems in general and in the particular case of chemistry, inspired me into the use of PowerPoint slides and animations throughout the lecture course at any point where the visualization of the microscopic phenomena by means of macroscopic analogs would help the students' understanding.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="technology-contribution">
        <h3>Innovation in Chemical Education</h3>
        <p>The introduction of computer modeling into the chemical curriculum of Santa Barbara City College is probably the most important contribution I have made to science education while fulfilling the requisites for this certificate. My fellow faculty members at SBCC were also very pleased to have this new teaching tool available for future use in their classes.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="syllabus-section">
        <h3>Comprehensive Syllabus Development</h3>
        <p>For this course I elaborated a rather complete syllabus, that can be found as <a href="Syllabus.html" target="_blank" class="external-link">Supporting Document C.1</a>. It contains most of the information needed to go through and succeed in the course, a detailed calendar of all activities and laboratories, and listing of paper and electronic resources available for the students. It took some work to get them used to look it up in the syllabus before asking, but in the long run, I guess they benefited from such a comprehensive document.</p>
        
        <p>The syllabus was handled as a paper copy during the first class, but it was also available on the web. I developed the syllabus using the <emph>Syllabus Maker</emph> software available at The Student Hub website. The students were required to visit the web version at least once a week, and that allowed me to communicate important changes and updates to the whole class. I have adopted this format for other courses taught after the first, and I hope as a future professor to continue this approach to the all-important syllabus.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="reflection-section">
        <h3>Reflection on Teaching Experience</h3>
        <p>Reflecting on this teaching experience, I learned about the differences in the needs and motivations of students at a community college and compared them with my previous experience as a teacher at a research university. The fact that the course taught at the City College is University of California transferable convinced me that I should not lower the level of the course but just put an extra effort in trying to bring all students to full speed in General Chemistry.</p>
        
        <p>The importance of having a well-organized and complete syllabus became evident to me, especially during the Summer session, when work is done under such great time constraints. I have the great opportunity of teaching the class again during the Fall semester, and all what I learned during the first run, found suitable application during the second. I guess that is the way in real life, where as a teacher you are always committed to improve your own record from the last time you taught the course.</p>
